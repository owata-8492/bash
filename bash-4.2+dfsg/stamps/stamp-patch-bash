bashbug-editor.diff:
  send bug reports to Debian bash maintainer too.

deb-bash-config.diff:
  Changed compile time configuration options:
  
  - Set the default path to comply with Debian policy
  
  - Enable System-wide .bashrc file for interactive shells.
  
  - Enable System-wide .bash.logout  file for interactive shells.
  
  - make non-interactive shells begun with argv[0][0] == '-'
  run the startup files when not in posix mode.
  
  - try to check whether bash is being run by sshd and source
  the .bashrc if so (like the rshd behavior).
  
  - don't define a default DEFAULT_MAIL_DIRECTORY, because it
  can cause a timeout on NFS mounts.

  Nope.  This will allow setuid scripts if not called as `sh' and not
